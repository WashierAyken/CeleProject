# CRUD PRO
FORM IN PHP.

I have created a CRUD project in PHP that allows me to manage my contacts online. It is a web application that lets me add, view, edit, and delete contacts from a MySQL database. I have used PDO to connect to the database and execute SQL queries that perform the CRUD operations. I have also used HTML forms and tables to display the data and collect user input. I have implemented validation rules and error handling to ensure the data integrity and user experience.

This project is a simple and useful way of learning how to work with databases and web development. It has helped me to improve my skills and knowledge in PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(PENDING). I have also learned how to use various tools and resources available online, such as templates, tutorials, documentation, and forums. I am proud of my project and I hope to use it for various purposes, such as keeping track of my personal or professional contacts, creating a blog or a forum, or developing a more complex web application.
